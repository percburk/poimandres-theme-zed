A faithful and meticulous port of the awesome poimandres VS Code theme for Zed. Some ports exist, but since Zed's syntax highlighting customization is not as fine grained as VS Code's as of now, some colors in those ports that poimandres uses sparingly are overrepresented in the actual buffer. This project makes the best compromises on syntax colors to offer as consistent colors with VS Code as possible. When decisions needed to be made, the lighter of the two color options was usually chosen for readability.
